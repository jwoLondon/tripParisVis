Bike sharing system data were collected using an API provided by VÃ©lib. These data are made available in realtime. Current versions of the API can be found here:

- Number of available bikes at stations : https://velib-metropole-opendata.smovengo.cloud/opendata/Velib_Metropole/station_status.json
- Location and characteristics of Velib' stations: https://velib-metropole-opendata.smovengo.cloud/opendata/Velib_Metropole/station_information.json

Historical bike counter data are available as Open Data and can be found here under an [Open Data Licence](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/).
