How did we move around cities during a global pandemic? How did lockdowns affect movement? 

These pages illustrate some answers to these questions using bike sharing system data and fixed bicycle counters from Paris. They accompany the paper **Evaluation of Bicycle Sharing Scheme Data as a Proxy for Cycling Mobility - How COVID-19 Measures influenced Cycling in Paris** by Stefan Ivanovic, Jo Wood and Ross Purves published in Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives.

You can explore data here:

- Public bicycle hire use across [Paris](docs/paris/).
- Bicycle counters [Paris](docs/parisCounter/).

This repository is a fork of the original mobv project, which was implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic. You can find the original visualizations and more [here](https://jwolondon.github.io/mobv/).
